# SceneKit-COLLADA-Demo
Just a small app I put together in Swift 4 to demonstrate loading and manipulating DAE files in SceneKit. Demonstrates both Local and Global rotations, as well as translation and zooming.  

Note that I opted to use simple SceneKit properties to perform all actions, not manual matrix manipulations.
